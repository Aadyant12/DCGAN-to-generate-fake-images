# GAN
This is a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to create fake images.
The model has been trained to generate images of wild animals. The images created by this model are of relatively low quality (64x64x3) since creating higher quality images requires much higher computational power. Nonetheless, it can be seen that the model was successfully able to generate pictures of wild animals. The quality of the output images can be scaled up easily with a few extra lines of code (Adding more layers to the generator model)
